The section **Additional Use Cases** is optional and will extend the demo environment or describe more advanced topics. Please find the ones relevant for you and try them out.

## Prerequisites

The credentials and token for the target applications will be supplied to you when you initialise the configuration.

At the end of the lab, the accounts will be automatically decommissioned. Only the Okta tenant generated for this event will remain active for your use.

**To ensure that the lab works properly and to access to Okta tenant, you will need to install Okta Verify on one of your devices.**

## Your domain

A custom domain in O365 is assigned automatically to each user in this lab. This custom domain is a pre-requisite to go through the different integrations afterwards. To get this custom domain, go to section 3 - O365, then click on the button **Launch** in the top left corner under **Office365**. You will be redirected then to the admin console of O365, grab the first first part after **labadmin@** then copy it but without the word **my**. In the example below, your custom domain is **wiclab56**.
